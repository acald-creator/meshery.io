        The Meshery community embraces developer-defined infrastructure. We empower developers to change how they write
        applications, support operators in rethinking how they run modern infrastructure, and enable product owners to
        regain full-control over their product portfolio. Our cloud native application and infrastructure management
        software enables organizations to expect more from their infrastructure.
        Our inclusive and diverse community stewards projects to provide learning environments, create and implement
        cloud native industry standards, deployment and operational best practices, benchmarks and abstractions, and
        more. Our pay-it-forward mentality with every contributor (mentee or not) is a shared commitment by all
        maintainers (and MeshMates - contributor onboarding buddies) to the open source spirit that pushes
        the project forward. New members are always welcome.

          Description: Enhance Meshery's existing orchestration capabilities to include support for kro ResourceGraphDefinitions (RGDs) as first-class <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models">Meshery Models</a>.
          This involves enabling Meshery to manage and orchestrate RGDs, similar to how it handles other Kubernetes resources.
          The project will also include generating support for ResourceGraphDefinition in Meshery's Model generator.

          <p class="sub_headings">Description:</p>
          Learning paths with hands-on labs are a crucial resource for DevOps engineers and cloud-native practitioners.
          The Meshery Playground provides a live cluster environment, making it an ideal platform for learning every kind of cloud and cloud native technology.
          Meshery Docs is in need of comprehensive tutorials and scenarios covering common infrastructure management use cases.

          Your mission in this internship is to create and publish a series of hands-on tutorials using Meshery Playground. Each tutorial will include step-by-step guides, live demonstrations, and interactive labs using the Playground allowing learners to apply their knowledge directly without the hassle of any configuration.
          These tutorials will be reviewed by various project maintainers and then published in <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/tutorials">guides/tutorials</a>.

          </h4>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <p class="sub_headings">Description:</p>
          Meshery integrates with many other CNCF projects and technologies. Sustaining those integrations is only possible through automation.
          To automate functional integration and end-to-end testing, Meshery now uses Playwright as one of the tools for browser testing. End-to-end tests run with each pull request to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality.
          Expanding the coverage of E2E tests is crucial to improving the reliability of Mesheryâ€™s UI and workflows. This project focuses on writing Playwright-based tests for more Meshery components, ensuring robust test coverage across the platform.

        </ol>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="project-list">Recommended Skills:</h5>
      <p class="program-p">JavaScript, Playwright, GitHub Workflows, familiarity with React or Nextjs would be helpful, CI/CD
